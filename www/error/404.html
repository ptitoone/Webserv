		The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.</br>
		In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.</br>
		Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource</br>
		from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent</br>
		occurrence on the web. For example, an API may not allow calling DELETE to remove a resource.
